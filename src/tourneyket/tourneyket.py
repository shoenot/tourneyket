"""Tourneyket
Easily represent and progress Bracket-style single elimination Tournaments,
allowing you to focus on matchup logic and analysis without worrying about the boilerplate. 

The Bracket object accepts an initial bracket and a function to select matchup winner.
Automatically fills out the rest of the bracket, and implements a method to print out the
final bracket to console in a nice, bracket shaped format.

    Class used to represent a tree-style tournament bracket.

    ...

    Attributes
    -----------
    bracket : list 
        The full, played out bracket, in list form. 
        Each list element is a another list containing the participants of each successive round.
        Final list element a list with a single element, containing the ultimate winner. 

    first_round_size: int 
        The number of elements in the first round of the bracket, 
        i.e. the length of the initial bracket list passed to create a Bracket object

    Methods
    ----------
    play_out_bracket(function: pick_winner = equal_chance) -> None
        Plays out the bracket to completion, picking between two teams in a given matchup 
        using the function passed as the pick_winner parameter.
        Defaults to random (equal) chance.

    print_bracket(function: formatting = lambda t: t, int: spaces) -> None
        Prints out the bracket with in a bracket shape. 
        If the argument 'key' isn't passed, prints out each bracket element as is (in a bracket shape).

        -----------

            A list of the initial bracket elements (first round competitors).
            MUST be of a length that is a power of 2.
            Needs to be ordered such that each matchup is next to each other.
            (i.e if first round is 1 v 4 and 2 v 3, and then second round between the winners of each matchup,
